# QR-JavaWebToken

This project delves into the utilization of Java web tokens for remote authentication. The primary use case encompasses authentication scenarios requiring an offline backup or offline functionality as a primary requirement. However, the applications extend beyond, spanning from event ticketing to various offline authentication needs.

These are the code repositories this project was built on and inspired by.
